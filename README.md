#### 1st prototype

A computer composed of two independants PCB manages the flight of Ragnarok I :

* One measures altitude using a BMP180 and triggers parachute ejection through the activation of a relay.
* One measures acceleration (MPU6050) and altitude, save them into the EEPROM memory of an arduino and is able to communicate it to a computer using a bluetooth connection.
